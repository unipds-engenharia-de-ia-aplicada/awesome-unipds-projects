# Awesome UNIPDS Projects 🎓

A curated list of original projects built by students of the **[UNIPDS Software engineering with Applied AI](https://unipds.com.br/org-erick-wendel/?utm_source=awesomeunipdsprojects&utm_medium=github&utm_term=&utm_content=awesomeunipdsprojects)** postgrad course.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a showcase of **original student work**. Projects inspired by course concepts are welcome, but must be brand new creations — not copies of exercises demonstrated in class.
